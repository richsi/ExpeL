TASK 2 Reflection 3

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually checked the same cabinets. I should have taken the tomato from the countertop 1, then cooled it with fridge 1, then put it in microwave 1. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

TASK 4 Reflection 2

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually checked handtowelholders 1 and 2 without finding a soapbar. I should have checked sinkbasin 1 and 2 first, then checked handtowelholders 1 and 2. If I am stuck in a loop again, I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

TASK 11 Reflection 2

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually opened the drawer 1 instead of finding a vase. I should have taken vase from drawer 1, then put it in safe. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

TASK 17 Reflection 1

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually examined fridge 1 instead of cleaning the mug 2 with sinkbasin 1. I should have taken mug 2 from fridge 1, then cleaned it with sinkbasin 1, then put it in/on coffeemachine 1. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 2, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 2, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.
Trial 1:
* First, I will look for a sinkbasin.
Trial 2:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually thought about finding a sinkbasin instead of taking action. I should have taken a sinkbasin, then cleaned the cloth with it, then put it in countertop. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.
Now it's your turn!

TASK 23 Reflection 3

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually examined sinkbasin 1 instead of cleaning the egg with sinkbasin 1. I should have taken the egg from drawer 1, then cleaned it with sinkbasin 1, then put it in/on microwave. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.
Trial 1:
In this environment, my plan was to find an egg, then clean it with sinkbasin, then put it in/on microwave. However, the task says to put a clean egg in microwave. I should have taken the egg from drawer 1, then cleaned it with sinkbasin, then put it in/on microwave. I noticed that the microwave was found on countertop 1. In the next trial, I will go to countertop 1, take the egg from drawer 1, clean it with sinkbasin, then put it in/on microwave.
Trial 2:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually examined fridge 1 instead of taking an egg. I should have taken an egg (1) from fridge 1, then cleaned it with sinkbasin 1, then put it in/on microwave. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

Trial 1:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually opened drawer 1 instead of putting pencil in shelf 1. I should have put pencil in shelf 1, then put creditcards in shelves. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.
Trial 2:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually checked drawer 1 without taking any action. I should have taken pencil 1 from drawer 1, then put it in shelf 1. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

TASK 46 Reflection 1

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually searched for a soapbottle. I should have taken the soapbottle 2 from cabinet 3, then put it in/on toilet 1. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

TASK 51 Reflection 1

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually examined drawer 1 instead of finding a mug. I should have taken mug 1 from drawer 1, then put it in desk 1. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

TASK 55 Reflection 2

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually thought about finding the first pillow without taking action. I should have taken the first pillow from drawer 1, then put it in sofa, then found and taken the second pillow, then put it in sofa. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

TASK 61 Reflection 2

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually thought about finding a potato without taking any action. I should have taken potato from drawer 1, then cooled it with fridge, then put it in microwave. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.
Trial 1:
In this trial, I was trying to cool a potato by putting it in the fridge. However, the task says to cool the potato first. I should have looked for a potato first, then cooled it in the fridge.

TASK 63 Reflection 3

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually examined microwave 1 instead of heating mug 2 with microwave 1. I should have taken mug 2 from fridge 1, then heated it with microwave 1, then put it in coffeemachine 1. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

TASK 80 Reflection 1

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually thought about finding a spatula without taking any action. I should have taken a spatula from countertop 1, then cleaned it with sinkbasin, then put it in drawer 1. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.
Now it's your turn!

TASK 84 Reflection 1

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
I was stuck in a loop in which I continually examined drawer 3 instead of putting the saltshaker in drawer 3. I should have taken the saltshaker 2 from cabinet 6, then put it in drawer 3. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.
Now it's your turn!
