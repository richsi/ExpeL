Question: The W. H. Shipman House is in what Hawaii county?
Thought 1: I need to search W. H. Shipman House and find its location.
Action 1: Search[W. H. Shipman House]
Observation 1: W. H. Shipman House is a historic home used by William Herbert Shipman.  It is located at 141 Kaʻiulani Street, named for Princess Kaʻiulani, the last crown princess of the Kingdom and Liliʻuokalani's niece.
In 1856 King Kamehameha IV leased an area known as Kolo iki to William Reed for cattle pasture. In 1861 Reed purchased the 26 acres (11 ha) and it came to be known as "Reed's Island". It is not really an island, but the area between a current and ancient channel of the Wailuku River.
J. R. "Jack" Wilson owned Volcano Stables, a horse rental business at the current site of the historic Volcano Block Building in Hilo. In 1899 after an iron bridge was completed, Wilson bought a 8-acre (3.2 ha) lot with a view on Reed's island and built a large house in the Victorian architecture style. It was designed by Honolulu architect Henry Livingston Kerr, and constructed with indoor plumbing and electricity. In addition to the main house placed prominently on a hill the estate includes a guest house, servants' quarters, gardens, and a garage. An unusual feature is the two-story round tower with conical roof, circular veranda, and large curved panes of glass.
In February 1901 William Shipman bought the house to entertain guests in the growing city of Hilo.
Deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani would play her compositions at the grand piano when she was visiting.
Author Jack London and his wife stayed at this house for five weeks in August and September 1907, while his boat The Snark was being repaired. London's book The Cruise of the Snark (1911) is based on this journey. 
In the early 1930s, Cecil B. DeMille filmed Four Frightened People in the gulch below the house, as well as on the Shipman land in Puna. In 1939 artist Georgia O'Keeffe stayed and was shown various sites that appeared in her paintings.
The Hilo house was listed on the state register of historic places on December 5, 1973, as site 10-35-7405, and the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on June 23, 1978, as site 78001013.
Barbara-Ann Andersen (daughter of Roy Shipman Blackshear, a great-granddaughter of W. H. Shipman) restored the house and operated it for roughly 20 years starting in 1997 as a bed and breakfast hotel.
Thought 2: The W. H. Shipman House is located at 141 Kaʻiulani Street. So the answer is Hawaii County.

Question: Sadok Sassi played for a national team that made its first World Cup in what year?
Thought 1: I need to search Sadok Sassi and find the national team he played for.
Action 1: Search[Sadok Sassi]
Observation 1: Sadok Sassi (Arabic: الصَّادِق سَاسِي), nicknamed "Attouga" (Arabic: عَتُوقَة; born 15 November 1945 in Tunis) is a Tunisian former footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Club Africain and the Tunisia national team.
He played both matches for the Tunisia national team at the 1963 African Cup of Nations.
In a sixteen-years career, Sassi earned an impressive five league titles, eight cups, including three for Tunisia and the Maghreb. In 1972, he was goalkeeper for the African team at the mini-World Cup, hosted by Brazil. As a one-club man, he has 335 appearances in the first Tunisian league, 66 in the Tunisian Cup, and 14 in international competitions. With a total of 415 official matches for Club Africain, Sadok Sassi is the club's record player. Due to his outstanding performances, Attouga is referred to by the club as the eternal number one.
The national team's undisputed first-choice goalkeeper for many years, he missed Tunisia's first World Cup appearance in 1978 through injury, and was replaced by Mokhtar Naili. Sassi earned a total of 116 international caps; however, only 87 matches were considered as A-international by FIFA. He was awarded the African Football's Silver Order of Merit by CAF.
In the prestigious election for CAF African Goalkeeper of the Millennium, Sadok Sassi finished in third place. The two goalkeepers who ranked ahead of him were Cameroonians Thomas N'Kono and Joseph-Antoine Bell. Therefore, Attouga is considered the best Tunisian and North African goalkeeper of the millennium.
After retiring he has worked as a General Manager for Club Africain.
Thought 2: Sadok Sassi played for Tunisia in the 1963 African Cup of Nations, but I did not find any information about the year of the first World Cup appearance of Tunisia. I should search for the Tunisia national football team and the World Cup instead of Sadok Sassi.
Action 2: Search[Tunisia national football team]

Additionally, the team is a member of the Union of North African Football (UNAF) and the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA). The team is colloquially known as Eagles of Carthage by fans and the media, with the bald eagle serving as its symbol. Their home kit is primarily white and their away kit is red, which is a reference to the national flag of the country. The team has qualified six times for the FIFA World Cup and twenty-one times for the Africa Cup of Nations. It has competed in four editions of Summer Olympics and participated once in the FIFA Confederation Cup. Since 2001, Tunisia's home stadium is the Hammadi Agrebi Stadium in Radès, Tunis.
Tunisia's first match after independence was against Libya, which they won 4–2. Periods of regular Tunisian representation at the highest international level, from 1962 to 1978, from 1994 to 2008 and again from 2014 onwards. The team qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 1978, and became the first African and Arab team to win a world cup match by beating Mexico 3–1 in the first match, they have since qualified six times and never making it past the group stage. The team qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations 22 times, the first time was in 1962 and won the title in 2004 when they hosted the event after beating Morocco in the final.

Action 3: Search[Patti Page birth year]
Observation 3: Clara Ann Fowler (November 8, 1927 – January 1, 2013), better known by her stage name Patti Page, was an American singer. Primarily known for pop and country music, she was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade-long career. She was often introduced as "the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page". New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as "A Page in my life called Patti".
Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's "Confess". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single "With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming", and eventually had 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.
Page's signature song, "Tennessee Waltz", was one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee. It spent 13 weeks atop the Billboard's best-sellers list in 1950/51. Page had three additional number-one hit singles between 1950 and 1953, "All My Love (Bolero)", "I Went to Your Wedding", and "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?".
Unlike most other pop singers, Page blended country music styles into many of her songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the Billboard Country Chart. In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades.
With the rise of rock and roll in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with "Old Cape Cod", "Allegheny Moon", "A Poor Man's Roses (or a Rich Man's Gold)", and "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte".
In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. She was posthumously honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013.

Sinatra is among the world's best-selling music artists, with an estimated 150 million record sales globally.
Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era and was influenced by the easy-listening vocal style of Bing Crosby. He joined the Harry James band as the vocalist in 1939 before finding success as a solo artist after signing with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the "bobby soxers". In 1946, Sinatra released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra. He then signed with Capitol Records and released several albums with arrangements by Nelson Riddle, notably In the Wee Small Hours (1955) and Songs for Swingin' Lovers! (1956). In 1960, Sinatra left Capitol Records to start his own record label, Reprise Records, releasing a string of successful albums. He collaborated with Count Basie on Sinatra-Basie: An Historic Musical First (1962) and It Might as Well Be Swing (1964). In 1965, he recorded September of My Years and starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music. After releasing Sinatra at the Sands in 1966, Sinatra recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim. It was followed by 1968's Francis A. & Edward K. with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired in 1971 following the release of "My Way" but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and released "New York, New York" in 1980.
Sinatra also forged a highly successful acting career. After winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for From Here to Eternity (1953), he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962). Sinatra also appeared in musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), which won him a Golden Globe Award. Toward the end of his career, he frequently played detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on CBS in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s.
In 1983, Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra received eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. American music critic Robert Christgau called him "the greatest singer of the 20th century" and he continues to be regarded as an iconic figure.

Observation 3: Clara Ann Fowler (November 8, 1927 – January 1, 2013), better known by her stage name Patti Page, was an American singer. Primarily known for pop and country music, she was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade-long career. She was often introduced as "the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page". New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as "A Page in my life called Patti".
Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's "Confess". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single "With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming", and eventually had 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.
Page's signature song, "Tennessee Waltz", was one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee. It spent 13 weeks atop the Billboard's best-sellers list in 1950/51. Page had three additional number-one hit singles between 1950 and 1953, "All My Love (Bolero)", "I Went to Your Wedding", and "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?".
Unlike most other pop singers, Page blended country music styles into many of her songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the Billboard Country Chart. In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades.
With the rise of rock and roll in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with "Old Cape Cod", "Allegheny Moon", "A Poor Man's Roses (or a Rich Man's Gold)", and "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte".
In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. She was posthumously honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013.

Observation 2: Stone Brewing (formerly Stone Brewing Co.) is a brewery headquartered in Escondido, California, United States. Founded in 1996 in San Marcos, it is the largest brewery in Southern California. Based on 2020 sales volume, it is the ninth largest craft brewery in the United States.
The brewery's first beer was Stone Pale Ale, which was considered to be its flagship ale until it was retired in 2015. The company's best known brand is Arrogant Bastard Ale, which has been described as a "watershed beer" that "put San Diego on the craft brew map."

Question: Jessica Jones is a television series created for Netflix, the second in the series of the shows that lead to "The Defenders" miniseries after what show released on Netflix earlier?
Thought 1: I need to search for the show that released on Netflix earlier than Jessica Jones.
Action 1: Search[The show that released on Netflix earlier than Jessica Jones]
Observation 1: Marvel's Netflix television series are a set of interconnected American television series created for the streaming service Netflix, based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. Produced by Marvel Television and ABC Studios, they are set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the franchise's films and other television series. Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb revealed the group of shows were known internally as the "Marvel Street-Level Heroes" or "Marvel Knights" series.
A deal between Marvel and Netflix to produce several interconnected series was announced in November 2013, with the individual series Daredevil (2015–2018), Jessica Jones (2015–2019), Luke Cage (2016–2018), and Iron Fist (2017–2018) culminating in the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017). A spin-off from Daredevil, The Punisher (2017–2019), was ordered in April 2016. The series were all filmed in New York State, forming the state's largest television production commitment across 161 episodes. They star Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones, Mike Colter as Luke Cage, and Finn Jones as Danny Rand / Iron Fist, who all star together in The Defenders, as well as Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher. Many actors have roles across the different series, including Rosario Dawson who signed a special deal to portray Claire Temple.
The series are believed to have generated strong viewership for Netflix, who do not release exact viewership details, and received positive reviews for their casts and darker take on the MCU. There were some common criticisms of the series, such as for their pacing. Netflix had cancelled all of the series by February 2019, when Marvel's parent company Disney was preparing its own streaming service, Disney+. The series were all removed from Netflix on March 1, 2022, after Disney regained the licenses for them, and they began streaming on Disney+ from March 16, where they were collected under the title "The Defenders Saga".
Contractually, Marvel had to wait two years before they could use the characters without Netflix. Vincent D'Onofrio and Cox were the first actors to reprise their roles in Marvel Studios-produced MCU projects, in December 2021. A new Daredevil series, titled Daredevil: Born Again (2025), was ordered for Disney+, with Cox, D'Onofrio, Bernthal, and other Daredevil cast members returning, while a Punisher-centered Marvel Studios Special Presentation television special is in development with Bernthal starring.
Thought 2: The show that released on Netflix earlier than Jessica Jones is Daredevil.
Action 2: Finish[Daredevil]
Observation 2: Answer is CORRECT
Thought 1: I need to search "The Defenders" miniseries and find the show that released on Netflix earlier.
Action 1: Search["The Defenders"]
Observation 1: Marvel's The Defenders is an American television miniseries created by Douglas Petrie and Marco Ramirez for the streaming service Netflix, based on the Marvel Comics characters Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, who form the eponymous superhero team. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the franchise's films. The miniseries is a crossover event and the culmination of four previously released interconnected series from Marvel and Netflix starring each superhero. It was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, Nine and a Half Fingers, Inc., and Goddard Textiles, with Ramirez serving as showrunner.
The series stars Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones, Mike Colter as Luke Cage, and Finn Jones as Danny Rand / Iron Fist, all reprising their roles from their individual series. It also stars Eka Darville, Elden Henson, Jessica Henwick, Simone Missick, Ramón Rodríguez, Rachael Taylor, Deborah Ann Woll, Élodie Yung, Rosario Dawson, and Scott Glenn, all also returning from previous series, as well as Sigourney Weaver. Development began in late 2013, with Cox the first actor cast in May 2014. Petrie and Ramirez joined as showrunners in April, after doing so for the second season of Daredevil. Petrie left with the start of filming, which took place in New York City from October 2016 to March 2017. Cinematography and design work established the different color palettes from the characters' individual series, and combined them as the team is formed.
The Defenders premiered in New York on July 31, 2017, with all eight episodes released on Netflix on August 18. Critics were mostly positive about the crossover, highlighting the dynamics between the different Defenders as well as Weaver's performance, but were generally disappointed with the overall story, pacing, and the use of the Hand as villains. Third-party analysis indicated that the miniseries was the least-viewed Marvel Netflix series so far and had the largest week-over-week drop in viewership of them all, though it was the third-most "Binge Raced" series globally at the time of its release, according to Netflix. It received several award nominations. The Defenders, along with the other Marvel Netflix series, was removed from Netflix on March 1, 2022, after Disney regained the license for the series. They began streaming on Disney+ from March 16.
Thought 2: The Defenders miniseries was a crossover event and the culmination of four previously released interconnected series from Marvel and Netflix starring each superhero. So the show that released on Netflix earlier must be one of those four series.
Action 2: Search[Daredevil]
Observation 2: Marvel's Daredevil is an American television series created by Drew Goddard for the streaming service Netflix, based on the Marvel Comics character Daredevil. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise, and was the first Marvel Netflix series leading to the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017). Daredevil was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios. Steven S. DeKnight served as showrunner for the first season, with Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez taking over as co-showrunners for the second, and Erik Oleson joining the series as showrunner for the third; Goddard served as a consultant for the series.
Charlie Cox stars as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a blind lawyer-by-day who fights crime as a masked vigilante by night. Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, Rosario Dawson, and Vincent D'Onofrio also star, with Toby Leonard Moore, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Bob Gunton, and Ayelet Zurer joining them for season one, Jon Bernthal, Élodie Yung, and Stephen Rider joining the cast for season two, and Joanne Whalley, Jay Ali and Wilson Bethel joining in season three. Daredevil entered development in late 2013, a year after the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel, with Goddard initially hired in December 2013. Cox was cast in May 2014, and the Daredevil costume was designed by Ryan Meinerding of Marvel Studios' design team. The series was intended to be darker than other Marvel projects, intentionally avoiding crossovers with the wider MCU and focusing on a crime fiction style that was inspired by 1970s films. Design inspiration was taken from the Hell's Kitchen setting of the comics, with filming taking place in New York City.
The first season was released in its entirety on Netflix on April 10, 2015, followed by the second on March 18, 2016, and the third on October 19, 2018. They were met with positive reviews, and received numerous accolades including several nominations for Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. A spin-off series centered on Bernthal's character Frank Castle / Punisher, titled The Punisher, was ordered by Netflix in April 2016. Netflix canceled Daredevil on November 29, 2018. It, along with the rest of Netflix's Marvel series, was moved from Netflix to Disney+ in March 2022 after Disney regained the license. Beginning in 2021, Cox and D'Onofrio reprised their roles as Murdock and Wilson Fisk / Kingpin in MCU projects produced by Marvel Studios, including a revival series for Disney+ titled Daredevil: Born Again (2025) in which Woll, Henson, Zurer, Bernthal, and Bethel also reprise their roles.
Thought 3: Daredevil is a Marvel Netflix series that was released on Netflix earlier than The Defenders miniseries. So Jessica Jones must be the other show that released on Netflix earlier.

Observation 3: Jessica Campbell Jones-Cage, professionally known as Jessica Jones, is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Michael Gaydos and first appeared in Alias #1 (November 2001) as part of Marvel's Max, an imprint for more mature content, and was later retroactively established to have first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #4 (June 1963) in the Silver Age of Comic Books as an unnamed classmate of Peter Parker, created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. Within the context of Marvel's shared universe, Jones is a former superhero who becomes the owner (and usually sole employee) of Alias Private Investigations. Bendis envisioned the series as centered on the private investigator superhero Jessica Drew, designing and characterising Jones as a reinvention of Drew returning to her P.I. origins, only deciding to make her a new P.I. character once he realized that the main character he was writing had a distinct-enough voice and background to differentiate her from Drew, though deciding to still name the character Jessica (after Drew) on the basis of how "two [people] can have the same first name".
Jones has since starred in three ongoing series: Alias, The Pulse, and Jessica Jones. Alias ran for 28 issues before ending in 2004, while The Pulse ran for 14 issues from April 2004 to May 2006. Jessica Jones debuted in October 2016, published as a tie-in with the self-titled television series. She became a member of the New Avengers, alongside her husband Luke Cage during Marvel's 2010 Heroic Age campaign. Currently, after the events of Devil's Reign in which Cage became the Mayor of New York City, Jones is now the first lady of New York City. 
She has used various aliases throughout her history, including Jewel, Knightress, Mrs. Cage, and Power Woman. Jessica Jones has been described as one of Marvel's most powerful female heroes.
Krysten Ritter portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) streaming television series Jessica Jones and The Defenders, with Elizabeth Cappuccino portraying a young Jessica in the first and second seasons of Jessica Jones.

Observation 4: Marvel's Daredevil is an American television series created by Drew Goddard for the streaming service Netflix, based on the Marvel Comics character Daredevil. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise, and was the first Marvel Netflix series leading to the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017). Daredevil was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios. Steven S. DeKnight served as showrunner for the first season, with Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez taking over as co-showrunners for the second, and Erik Oleson joining the series as showrunner for the third; Goddard served as a consultant for the series.
Charlie Cox stars as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a blind lawyer-by-day who fights crime as a masked vigilante by night. Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, Rosario Dawson, and Vincent D'Onofrio also star, with Toby Leonard Moore, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Bob Gunton, and Ayelet Zurer joining them for season one, Jon Bernthal, Élodie Yung, and Stephen Rider joining the cast for season two, and Joanne Whalley, Jay Ali and Wilson Bethel joining in season three. Daredevil entered development in late 2013, a year after the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel, with Goddard initially hired in December 2013. Cox was cast in May 2014, and the Daredevil costume was designed by Ryan Meinerding of Marvel Studios' design team. The series was intended to be darker than other Marvel projects, intentionally avoiding crossovers with the wider MCU and focusing on a crime fiction style that was inspired by 1970s films. Design inspiration was taken from the Hell's Kitchen setting of the comics, with filming taking place in New York City.
The first season was released in its entirety on Netflix on April 10, 2015, followed by the second on March 18, 2016, and the third on October 19, 2018. They were met with positive reviews, and received numerous accolades including several nominations for Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. A spin-off series centered on Bernthal's character Frank Castle / Punisher, titled The Punisher, was ordered by Netflix in April 2016. Netflix canceled Daredevil on November 29, 2018. It, along with the rest of Netflix's Marvel series, was moved from Netflix to Disney+ in March 2022 after Disney regained the license. Beginning in 2021, Cox and D'Onofrio reprised their roles as Murdock and Wilson Fisk / Kingpin in MCU projects produced by Marvel Studios, including a revival series for Disney+ titled Daredevil: Born Again (2025) in which Woll, Henson, Zurer, Bernthal, and Bethel also reprise their roles.

Observation 5: Jessica Campbell Jones-Cage, professionally known as Jessica Jones, is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Michael Gaydos and first appeared in Alias #1 (November 2001) as part of Marvel's Max, an imprint for more mature content, and was later retroactively established to have first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #4 (June 1963) in the Silver Age of Comic Books as an unnamed classmate of Peter Parker, created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. Within the context of Marvel's shared universe, Jones is a former superhero who becomes the owner (and usually sole employee) of Alias Private Investigations. Bendis envisioned the series as centered on the private investigator superhero Jessica Drew, designing and characterising Jones as a reinvention of Drew returning to her P.I. origins, only deciding to make her a new P.I. character once he realized that the main character he was writing had a distinct-enough voice and background to differentiate her from Drew, though deciding to still name the character Jessica (after Drew) on the basis of how "two [people] can have the same first name".
Jones has since starred in three ongoing series: Alias, The Pulse, and Jessica Jones. Alias ran for 28 issues before ending in 2004, while The Pulse ran for 14 issues from April 2004 to May 2006. Jessica Jones debuted in October 2016, published as a tie-in with the self-titled television series. She became a member of the New Avengers, alongside her husband Luke Cage during Marvel's 2010 Heroic Age campaign. Currently, after the events of Devil's Reign in which Cage became the Mayor of New York City, Jones is now the first lady of New York City.

Question: Jessica Jones is a television series created for Netflix, the second in the series of the shows that lead to "The Defenders" miniseries after what show released on Netflix earlier?
Thought 1: I need to search for the show that released on Netflix earlier than Jessica Jones.
Action 1: Search[The show that released on Netflix earlier than Jessica Jones]
Observation 1: Marvel's Netflix television series are a set of interconnected American television series created for the streaming service Netflix, based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. Produced by Marvel Television and ABC Studios, they are set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the franchise's films and other television series. Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb revealed the group of shows were known internally as the "Marvel Street-Level Heroes" or "Marvel Knights" series.
A deal between Marvel and Netflix to produce several interconnected series was announced in November 2013, with the individual series Daredevil (2015–2018), Jessica Jones (2015–2019), Luke Cage (2016–2018), and Iron Fist (2017–2018) culminating in the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017). A spin-off from Daredevil, The Punisher (2017–2019), was ordered in April 2016. The series were all filmed in New York State, forming the state's largest television production commitment across 161 episodes. They star Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones, Mike Colter as Luke Cage, and Finn Jones as Danny Rand / Iron Fist, who all star together in The Defenders, as well as Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher. Many actors have roles across the different series, including Rosario Dawson who signed a special deal to portray Claire Temple.
The series are believed to have generated strong viewership for Netflix, who do not release exact viewership details, and received positive reviews for their casts and darker take on the MCU. There were some common criticisms of the series, such as for their pacing. Netflix had cancelled all of the series by February 2019, when Marvel's parent company Disney was preparing its own streaming service, Disney+. The series were all removed from Netflix on March 1, 2022, after Disney regained the licenses for them, and they began streaming on Disney+ from March 16, where they were collected under the title "The Defenders Saga".
Contractually, Marvel had to wait two years before they could use the characters without Netflix. Vincent D'Onofrio and Cox were the first actors to reprise their roles in Marvel Studios-produced MCU projects, in December 2021. A new Daredevil series, titled Daredevil: Born Again (2025), was ordered for Disney+, with Cox, D'Onofrio, Bernthal, and other Daredevil cast members returning, while a Punisher-centered Marvel Studios Special Presentation television special is in development with Bernthal starring.

Question: The chicken is a type of dance pattern that is a change of pace of what dance?
Thought 1: I need to search for the dance pattern that is a change of pace of the chicken.
Action 1: Search[change of pace of chicken]
Observation 1: The Chicken is a popular rhythm and blues dance that started in America in the 1950s, in which the dancers flapped their arms and kicked back their feet in an imitation of a chicken.  The dance featured lateral body movements.  It was used primarily as a change of pace step while doing the twist. The chicken dance gained popularity when Rufus Thomas wrote "Do the Funky Chicken", a hit record in 1970.
Thought 2: The chicken is a change of pace step while doing the twist. So the dance pattern that is a change of pace of the chicken is the twist.
Action 2: Search[change of pace of twist]
Observation 2: A plot twist is a literary technique that introduces a radical change in the direction or expected outcome of the plot in a work of fiction. When it happens near the end of a story, it is known as a twist ending or surprise ending. It may change the audience's perception of the preceding events, or introduce a new conflict that places it in a different context. A plot twist may be foreshadowed, to prepare the audience to accept it, but it usually comes with some element of surprise. There are various methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience, or misleading them with ambiguous or false information. Not every plot has a twist, but some have multiple lesser ones, and some are defined by a single major twist.
Since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience's not having expected it, revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a spoiler. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience's expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.
Many television series, especially in crime fiction, use plot twists as a theme in every episode and some base their whole premise on the twist; for example, The Twilight Zone and Tales of the Unexpected.
Thought 3: The twist is a literary technique that introduces a radical change in the direction or expected outcome of the plot in a work of fiction. So the dance pattern that is a change of pace of the chicken is the twist.

Question: Otterington railway station was on a 393 mi major railway that linked Edinburgh to what city?
Thought 1: I need to search for the major railway that linked Edinburgh to a city.
Action 1: Search[major railway that linked Edinburgh to a city]
Observation 1: Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 council areas. The city is located in southeast Scotland and is bounded to the north by the Firth of Forth and to the south by the Pentland Hills. Edinburgh had a population of 
506,520 in 2020, making it the second-most populous city in Scotland and the seventh-most populous in the United Kingdom. The wider metropolitan area had a population of 912,490 in the same year.
Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, the highest courts in Scotland, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the monarch in Scotland. It is also the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is considered one of the best research institutions in the world. The financial centre of Scotland, Edinburgh is the second-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom, the fourth largest in Europe, and the thirteenth largest internationally.
The city is a cultural centre, and is the home of institutions including the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. The city is also known for the Edinburgh International Festival and the Fringe, the latter being the world's largest annual international arts festival. Historic sites in Edinburgh include Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the churches of St. Giles, Greyfriars and the Canongate, and the extensive Georgian New Town built in the 18th/19th centuries. Edinburgh's Old Town and New Town together are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which has been managed by Edinburgh World Heritage since 1999. The city's historical and cultural attractions have made it the UK's second-most visited tourist destination, attracting 4.9 million visits, including 2.4 million from overseas in 2018.
Edinburgh is governed by the City of Edinburgh Council, a unitary authority. The City of Edinburgh council area had an estimated population of 514,990 in 2022, and includes outlying towns and villages which are not part of Edinburgh proper. The city is in the Lothian region and was historically part of the shire of Midlothian (also called Edinburghshire).
Thought 2: The major railway that linked Edinburgh to a city is the East Coast Main Line.
Action 2: Search[East Coast Main Line]
Observation 2: The East Coast Main Line (ECML) is a 393-mile long (632 km) electrified railway between its northern terminus at Edinburgh Waverley and southern terminus at London King's Cross.  The key towns and cities of Peterborough, Doncaster, York, Darlington, Durham and Newcastle are on the line. The line is a key transport artery on the eastern side of Great Britain running broadly parallel to the A1 road. The main line acts as a 'spine' for several diverging branches, serving destinations such as Cambridge, Leeds, Hull, Sunderland and Lincoln, all with direct services to London. In addition, a few ECML services extend beyond Edinburgh to serve other Scottish destinations, such as Stirling, Inverness, Dundee, or Aberdeen.
The line was built during the 1840s by three railway companies, the North British Railway, the North Eastern Railway, and the Great Northern Railway. In 1923, the Railways Act 1921 led to their amalgamation to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the line became its primary route. The LNER competed with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) for long-distance passenger traffic between London and Scotland. The LNER's chief mechanical engineer Nigel Gresley designed iconic Pacific steam locomotives including Flying Scotsman and Mallard, the latter of which achieved a world record speed for a steam locomotive, 126 mph (203 km/h) on the Grantham-to-Peterborough section.
In 1948, the railways were nationalised and operated by British Railways. In the early 1960s, steam was replaced by diesel-electric traction, including the Deltics, and sections of the line were upgraded so that trains could run at speeds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h). With the demand for higher speed, British Rail introduced InterCity 125 high-speed trains between 1976 and 1981. In 1973, a Class 41 (an HST prototype) achieved a top speed of 143 mph (230 km/h) in a test run. In the 1980s, the line was electrified and InterCity 225 trains introduced. These have in turn been largely replaced by Class 800 and Class 801 units. The November 2021 Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands stated that the linespeed would be upgraded to 140 mph (225 km/h).
The line links London, South East England, East Anglia and the East Midlands, with Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland, and is important to their local economies. It carries commuter traffic in north London as well as cross-country, commuter and local passenger services, and freight. In 1997, operations were privatised. The primary long-distance operator is London North Eastern Railway, but open-access competition on services to Northern England and Scotland is provided by Hull Trains, Grand Central and Lumo.
Thought 3: The answer is London.

Question: Are both Lygodium or Maxillaria a genus of orchids?
Thought 1: I need to search Lygodium and Maxillaria, find their types, then find if they are both a genus of orchids.
Action 1: Search[Lygodium]
Observation 1: Lygodium (climbing fern) is a genus of about 40 species of ferns, native to tropical regions across the world, with a few temperate species in eastern Asia and eastern North America. It is the sole genus in the family Lygodiaceae  in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Alternatively, the genus may be placed as the only genus in the subfamily Lygodioideae of a more broadly defined family Schizaeaceae, the family placement used in Plants of the World Online as of November 2019. Per recent molecular evidence, Lygodiaceae is thought to have diverged relatively early from the other members of the Schizaeales due to the relatively high level of synonymous sequence divergence between the families within the Schizaeales.
Thought 2: Lygodium is not a genus of orchids. I need to search Maxillaria next.
Action 2: Search[Maxillaria]
Observation 2: Maxillaria, abbreviated as Max in the horticultural trade, is a large genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae). This is a diverse genus, with very different morphological forms. Their characteristics can vary widely.
They are commonly called spider orchids, flame orchids or tiger orchids. Their scientific name is derived from the Latin word maxilla, meaning jawbone, reflecting on the column and the base of the lip of some species, that may evoke a protruding jaw.
Thought 3: Maxillaria is a genus of orchids. So Lygodium and Maxillaria are not both a genus of orchids.
Action 3: Finish[no]

Observation 1: Ruggero Deodato (Italian pronunciation: [rudˈdʒɛːro de.oˈda.to]; 7 May 1939 – 29 December 2022) was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and actor.
His career spanned a wide-range of genres including peplum, comedy, drama, poliziottesco, and science fiction, yet he is perhaps best known for directing violent and gory horror films with strong elements of realism. His most notable film is Cannibal Holocaust, considered one of the most controversial and brutal in the history of cinema, which was seized, banned or heavily censored in many countries, and which contained special effects so realistic that they led to Deodato being arrested on suspicion of murder. It is also cited as a precursor of found footage films such as The Blair Witch Project and The Last Broadcast. The film strengthened Deodato's fame as an "extreme" director and earned him the nickname "Monsieur Cannibal" in France.
Deodato was an influence on film directors like Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth and Nicolas Winding Refn.
Thought 2: Ruggero Deodato is a film director. I need to search Alejandro Springall next and find its profession.
Action 2: Search[Alejandro Springall]

Springall studied filmmaking at the London Film School. He returned to Mexico City in 1991 and started working with Mexican film producer Bertha Navarro, from whom he learned most of his producing skills. Springall started his career as a producer, but in 1996 he directed his first feature film, Santitos. Since 1996 Springall has been collaborating with John Sayles, Maggie Renzi and Lemore Syvan. Results of that collaboration have been: Men with Guns, directed by Sayles, produced by Renzi, where Springall translated the script into Spanish and played a small role next to Federico Luppi; Santitos was executive produced by Sayles, Renzi and Syvan; Casa de los Babys, directed by Sayles was produced by Syvan and Springall; Morirse está en hebreo (My Mexican Shivah) was executive produced by Sayles, Renzi and Syvan; and Springall's new project, Air & Fire, was re-written by Sayles.
In 2003, Springall produced and directed the grand concert of Chavela Vargas at Carnegie Hall, New York; and in 2004, he directed the grand concert of Chavela Vargas at Luna Park Stadium, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Thought 3: Alejandro Springall is a film director and producer. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work.

Thought 3: The singer who popularized "I'll Keep the Lovelight Burning" is Patti Page. I need to search for Patti Page's birth year.
Action 3: Search[Patti Page birth year]
Observation 3: Clara Ann Fowler (November 8, 1927 – January 1, 2013), better known by her stage name Patti Page, was an American singer. Primarily known for pop and country music, she was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade-long career. She was often introduced as "the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page". New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as "A Page in my life called Patti".
Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's "Confess". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single "With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming", and eventually had 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.
Page's signature song, "Tennessee Waltz", was one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee. It spent 13 weeks atop the Billboard's best-sellers list in 1950/51. Page had three additional number-one hit singles between 1950 and 1953, "All My Love (Bolero)", "I Went to Your Wedding", and "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?".
Unlike most other pop singers, Page blended country music styles into many of her songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the Billboard Country Chart. In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades.
With the rise of rock and roll in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with "Old Cape Cod", "Allegheny Moon", "A Poor Man's Roses (or a Rich Man's Gold)", and "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte".
In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. She was posthumously honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013.
Thought 4: Patti Page was born in 1927. I need to return 1927 as the birth year.

Observation 1: Marvel's Netflix television series are a set of interconnected American television series created for the streaming service Netflix, based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. Produced by Marvel Television and ABC Studios, they are set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the franchise's films and other television series. Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb revealed the group of shows were known internally as the "Marvel Street-Level Heroes" or "Marvel Knights" series.
A deal between Marvel and Netflix to produce several interconnected series was announced in November 2013, with the individual series Daredevil (2015–2018), Jessica Jones (2015–2019), Luke Cage (2016–2018), and Iron Fist (2017–2018) culminating in the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017). A spin-off from Daredevil, The Punisher (2017–2019), was ordered in April 2016. The series were all filmed in New York State, forming the state's largest television production commitment across 161 episodes. They star Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones, Mike Colter as Luke Cage, and Finn Jones as Danny Rand / Iron Fist, who all star together in The Defenders, as well as Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher. Many actors have roles across the different series, including Rosario Dawson who signed a special deal to portray Claire Temple.
The series are believed to have generated strong viewership for Netflix, who do not release exact viewership details, and received positive reviews for their casts and darker take on the MCU. There were some common criticisms of the series, such as for their pacing. Netflix had cancelled all of the series by February 2019, when Marvel's parent company Disney was preparing its own streaming service, Disney+. The series were all removed from Netflix on March 1, 2022, after Disney regained the licenses for them, and they began streaming on Disney+ from March 16, where they were collected under the title "The Defenders Saga".
Contractually, Marvel had to wait two years before they could use the characters without Netflix. Vincent D'Onofrio and Cox were the first actors to reprise their roles in Marvel Studios-produced MCU projects, in December 2021. A new Daredevil series, titled Daredevil: Born Again (2025), was ordered for Disney+, with Cox, D'Onofrio, Bernthal, and other Daredevil cast members returning, while a Punisher-centered Marvel Studios Special Presentation television special is in development with Bernthal starring.
Thought 2: The show that released on Netflix earlier than Jessica Jones is Daredevil.

Thought 1: I need to search Darren Benjamin Shepherd and Rémi Lange, find their nationalities, then find if they are both American.
Action 1: Search[Darren Benjamin Shepherd]
Observation 1: Darren Benjamin Shepherd is an American screenwriter, film director and editor.   He was born in San Jose, CA and graduated with film and music degrees from San Jose State University.
He wrote the film The First Ride of Wyatt Earp released as Wyatt Earp's Revenge starring Val Kilmer in the lead role as Wyatt Earp.   Jeffrey Schenck produced and Peter Sullivan co-produced. He also co-directed New Hope Landing, a short film in the horror genre.

His background includes a short career as a professional musician in Las Vegas, NV.
Thought 2: Darren Benjamin Shepherd is American. I need to search Rémi Lange next and find its nationality.
Action 2: Search[Rémi Lange]
Observation 2: Rémi Lange (born 4 February 1969 in Gennevilliers, Hauts-de-Seine) is a French film director. Lange's films have mostly been released directly to video, except Omelette (1998) where he filmed his own coming out, and its sequel Les Yeux brouillés (2000), which both had general cinematic release in France. His films have been shown and have won awards at film festivals around the world.
Lange's films are not well known, but they do have a certain following. His usual themes are sexuality, notably homosexuality and queer culture (The Sex of Madame H, 2005). His films sometimes deliberately use amateur technology (Super 8 or miniDV). They are rich in personalities and events, macabre and funny at the same time, and always provocative. Lange touched on comedy and horror with Mes Parents (2004).
Lange founded his production company Les Films de l'Ange in 2004. In 2006, Lange directed Statross le Magnifique which was released on DVD in France in June 2006.
In 2007, Lange directed Devotee which was screened at many gay and lesbian film festivals. The OUTFEST 2008 guide described it as : "Daring and straightforward, DEVOTEE is the story of Hervé, an assertive 43-year-old man who was born without arms or legs. He meets a gorgeous young man online, a devotee (devoteeism (or acrotomophilia) is the sexual attraction to people with amputations) who seems like he might be different. Their encounter proves Hervé’s difficulty in finding a true connection with someone who is interested in treating him like a person rather than a mere fetish." Devotee was DVD released on the US in 2009.
Lange's fifth feature, Partir, the story of a young Tunisian boy going to France to shoot an underground movie, was released on DVD in France in August 2009.
Thought 3: Rémi Lange is French. So Darren Benjamin Shepherd and Rémi Lange are not both American.

Question: The W. H. Shipman House is in what Hawaii county?
Thought 1: I need to search W. H. Shipman House and find its location.
Action 1: Search[W. H. Shipman House]
Observation 1: W. H. Shipman House is a historic home used by William Herbert Shipman.  It is located at 141 Kaʻiulani Street, named for Princess Kaʻiulani, the last crown princess of the Kingdom and Liliʻuokalani's niece.
In 1856 King Kamehameha IV leased an area known as Kolo iki to William Reed for cattle pasture. In 1861 Reed purchased the 26 acres (11 ha) and it came to be known as "Reed's Island". It is not really an island, but the area between a current and ancient channel of the Wailuku River.
J. R. "Jack" Wilson owned Volcano Stables, a horse rental business at the current site of the historic Volcano Block Building in Hilo. In 1899 after an iron bridge was completed, Wilson bought a 8-acre (3.2 ha) lot with a view on Reed's island and built a large house in the Victorian architecture style. It was designed by Honolulu architect Henry Livingston Kerr, and constructed with indoor plumbing and electricity. In addition to the main house placed prominently on a hill the estate includes a guest house, servants' quarters, gardens, and a garage. An unusual feature is the two-story round tower with conical roof, circular veranda, and large curved panes of glass.
In February 1901 William Shipman bought the house to entertain guests in the growing city of Hilo.
Deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani would play her compositions at the grand piano when she was visiting.
Author Jack London and his wife stayed at this house for five weeks in August and September 1907, while his boat The Snark was being repaired. London's book The Cruise of the Snark (1911) is based on this journey. 
In the early 1930s, Cecil B. DeMille filmed Four Frightened People in the gulch below the house, as well as on the Shipman land in Puna. In 1939 artist Georgia O'Keeffe stayed and was shown various sites that appeared in her paintings.
The Hilo house was listed on the state register of historic places on December 5, 1973, as site 10-35-7405, and the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on June 23, 1978, as site 78001013.
Barbara-Ann Andersen (daughter of Roy Shipman Blackshear, a great-granddaughter of W. H. Shipman) restored the house and operated it for roughly 20 years starting in 1997 as a bed and breakfast hotel.
Thought 2: The W. H. Shipman House is located at 141 Kaʻiulani Street. So the answer is Hawaii County.
Action 2: Finish[Hawaii County]
Observation 2: Answer is CORRECT

Question: The chicken is a type of dance pattern that is a change of pace of what dance?
Thought 1: I need to search for the dance pattern that is a change of pace of the chicken.
Action 1: Search[change of pace of chicken]
Observation 1: The Chicken is a popular rhythm and blues dance that started in America in the 1950s, in which the dancers flapped their arms and kicked back their feet in an imitation of a chicken.  The dance featured lateral body movements.  It was used primarily as a change of pace step while doing the twist. The chicken dance gained popularity when Rufus Thomas wrote "Do the Funky Chicken", a hit record in 1970.
Thought 2: The chicken is a change of pace step while doing the twist. So the dance pattern that is a change of pace of the chicken is the twist.
Action 2: Search[change of pace of twist]
Observation 2: A plot twist is a literary technique that introduces a radical change in the direction or expected outcome of the plot in a work of fiction. When it happens near the end of a story, it is known as a twist ending or surprise ending. It may change the audience's perception of the preceding events, or introduce a new conflict that places it in a different context. A plot twist may be foreshadowed, to prepare the audience to accept it, but it usually comes with some element of surprise. There are various methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience, or misleading them with ambiguous or false information. Not every plot has a twist, but some have multiple lesser ones, and some are defined by a single major twist.
Since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience's not having expected it, revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a spoiler. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience's expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.
Many television series, especially in crime fiction, use plot twists as a theme in every episode and some base their whole premise on the twist; for example, The Twilight Zone and Tales of the Unexpected.
Thought 3: The twist is a literary technique that introduces a radical change in the direction or expected outcome of the plot in a work of fiction. So the dance pattern that is a change of pace of the chicken is the twist.
Action 3: Finish[twist]

Observation 1: Answer is CORRECT

Question: Sadok Sassi played for a national team that made its first World Cup in what year?
Thought 1: I need to search Sadok Sassi and find the national team he played for.
Action 1: Search[Sadok Sassi]
Observation 1: Sadok Sassi (Arabic: الصَّادِق سَاسِي), nicknamed "Attouga" (Arabic: عَتُوقَة; born 15 November 1945 in Tunis) is a Tunisian former footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Club Africain and the Tunisia national team.
He played both matches for the Tunisia national team at the 1963 African Cup of Nations.
In a sixteen-years career, Sassi earned an impressive five league titles, eight cups, including three for Tunisia and the Maghreb. In 1972, he was goalkeeper for the African team at the mini-World Cup, hosted by Brazil. As a one-club man, he has 335 appearances in the first Tunisian league, 66 in the Tunisian Cup, and 14 in international competitions. With a total of 415 official matches for Club Africain, Sadok Sassi is the club's record player. Due to his outstanding performances, Attouga is referred to by the club as the eternal number one.
The national team's undisputed first-choice goalkeeper for many years, he missed Tunisia's first World Cup appearance in 1978 through injury, and was replaced by Mokhtar Naili. Sassi earned a total of 116 international caps; however, only 87 matches were considered as A-international by FIFA. He was awarded the African Football's Silver Order of Merit by CAF.
In the prestigious election for CAF African Goalkeeper of the Millennium, Sadok Sassi finished in third place. The two goalkeepers who ranked ahead of him were Cameroonians Thomas N'Kono and Joseph-Antoine Bell. Therefore, Attouga is considered the best Tunisian and North African goalkeeper of the millennium.
After retiring he has worked as a General Manager for Club Africain.
Thought 2: Sadok Sassi played for Tunisia in the 1963 African Cup of Nations, but I did not find any information about the year of the first World Cup appearance of Tunisia. I should search for the Tunisia national football team and the World Cup instead of Sadok Sassi.
Action 2: Search[Tunisia national football team]
Observation 2: The Tunisia national football team, controlled by the Tunisian Football Federation (TFF), represents Tunisia in men's international association football competitions. On a continental level, the team competes under the Confederation of African Football (CAF). It is also affiliated with FIFA for global competitions. Additionally, the team is a member of the Union of North African Football (UNAF) and the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA). The team is colloquially known as Eagles of Carthage by fans and the media, with the bald eagle serving as its symbol. Their home kit is primarily white and their away kit is red, which is a reference to the national flag of the country. The team has qualified six times for the FIFA World Cup and twenty-one times for the Africa Cup of Nations. It has competed in four editions of Summer Olympics and participated once in the FIFA Confederation Cup. Since 2001, Tunisia's home stadium is the Hammadi Agrebi Stadium in Radès, Tunis.
Tunisia's first match after independence was against Libya, which they won 4–2. Periods of regular Tunisian representation at the highest international level, from 1962 to 1978, from 1994 to 2008 and again from 2014 onwards. The team qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 1978, and became the first African and Arab team to win a world cup match by beating Mexico 3–1 in the first match, they have since qualified six times and never making it past the group stage. The team qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations 22 times, the first time was in 1962 and won the title in 2004 when they hosted the event after beating Morocco in the final.  Tunisia qualified for the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2005 and was eliminated in the group stage. The team won the African Nations Championship in 2011 by beating Angola in the final and the FIFA Arab Cup in 1963, eventually winning with 8 points on their first participation.
Radhi Jaïdi, with 105 international matches, holds the record for the number of matches played on the Tunisian national team while Issam Jemâa, with 36 goals, is their all-time highest scorer. The highest rank reached by the team in the FIFA Men's World Ranking is 14th in April and May 2018, while their lowest rank is 65th in July 2010. Tunisia holds the record for most African Cup of Nations attended, appearing at seventeen consecutive tournaments. They have not been absent from the competition since the 1994 edition.
Thought 3: The national team's undisputed first-choice goalkeeper for many years, Sadok Sassi missed Tunisia's first World Cup appearance in 1978 through injury, and was replaced by Mokhtar Naili. Therefore, the year of the first World Cup appearance of Tunisia is 1978.
Action 3: Finish[1978]

Question: The creator of "Wallace and Gromit" also created what animation comedy that matched animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes? 
Thought 1: I need to search Wallace & Gromit, find the animation comedy that matches animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes, and return the name of the animation comedy.
Action 1: Search[Wallace & Gromit]
Observation 1: Wallace & Gromit is a British claymation comedy franchise created by Nick Park and produced by Aardman Animations.  The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic beagle. It consists of four short films, two feature-length films, and numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was finished and released in 1989. Wallace has been voiced by Peter Sallis and Ben Whitehead. While Wallace speaks very often, Gromit is largely silent and has no dialogue, communicating through facial expressions and body language.
Because of their popularity, the characters have been described as positive international cultural icons of both modern British culture and British people in general. BBC News called them "some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK". Icons has said they have done "more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors".
Park has stated that he was inspired by his childhood through the 1950s and 1960s in Lancashire in Northern England. The setting is deliberately ambiguous: the overall style resembles the 1960s, but numerous anachronisms abound, such as the use of 21st-century technology. Although Wigan is seen at the end of Wallace's alliterative home address on his letters, his accent comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire and he is especially fond of Wensleydale cheese (from North Yorkshire).
Their films have been widely praised, with the first three short films, A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995) earning 100% on Rotten Tomatoes; the feature film Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) has also received acclaim. The film is the second-highest-grossing stop-motion animated film, outgrossed only by Chicken Run (2000), another creation of Park's. A fourth short film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was released in 2008. A second full-length feature film, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl — marking the return of the penguin Feathers McGraw, the villain from The Wrong Trousers — was released in 2024. The franchise has received numerous accolades, including five BAFTAs, three Academy Awards and a Peabody Award.

Question: The creator of "Wallace and Gromit" also created what animation comedy that matched animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes? 
Thought 1: I need to search Wallace & Gromit, find the animation comedy that matches animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes, and return the name of the animation comedy.
Action 1: Search[Wallace & Gromit]
Observation 1: Wallace & Gromit is a British claymation comedy franchise created by Nick Park and produced by Aardman Animations.  The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic beagle. It consists of four short films, two feature-length films, and numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was finished and released in 1989. Wallace has been voiced by Peter Sallis and Ben Whitehead. While Wallace speaks very often, Gromit is largely silent and has no dialogue, communicating through facial expressions and body language.
Because of their popularity, the characters have been described as positive international cultural icons of both modern British culture and British people in general. BBC News called them "some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK". Icons has said they have done "more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors".
Park has stated that he was inspired by his childhood through the 1950s and 1960s in Lancashire in Northern England. The setting is deliberately ambiguous: the overall style resembles the 1960s, but numerous anachronisms abound, such as the use of 21st-century technology. Although Wigan is seen at the end of Wallace's alliterative home address on his letters, his accent comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire and he is especially fond of Wensleydale cheese (from North Yorkshire).
Their films have been widely praised, with the first three short films, A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995) earning 100% on Rotten Tomatoes; the feature film Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) has also received acclaim. The film is the second-highest-grossing stop-motion animated film, outgrossed only by Chicken Run (2000), another creation of Park's. A fourth short film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was released in 2008. A second full-length feature film, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl — marking the return of the penguin Feathers McGraw, the villain from The Wrong Trousers — was released in 2024. The franchise has received numerous accolades, including five BAFTAs, three Academy Awards and a Peabody Award.

In 2003, a television series in the same style was released. An American version of the series was also made. A sequel series, Things We Love, first aired on BBC One in 2024.

Question: Is Velvetpark or Shape magazine written more for a lesbian and queer-identified female readership?
Thought 1: I need to search Velvetpark and Shape magazine, find their target readerships, then find which is written more for a lesbian and queer-identified female readership.
Action 1: Search[Velvetpark]
Observation 1: Velvetpark: Dyke Culture in Bloom is a lesbian and feminist arts and culture American website that regularly features music, literature, theater, fine arts, film, television, and social activism as it impacts queer culture. Velvetpark also hosts a social network and dating community for lesbians and queer-identified women.
Thought 2: Velvetpark is a lesbian and feminist arts and culture website that also hosts a social network and dating community for lesbians and queer-identified women. I need to search Shape magazine next and find its target readership.
Action 2: Search[Shape magazine]
Observation 2: Shape  (stylized in all caps) is an American monthly fitness magazine started by Weider Publications in 1981, founded by Christine MacIntyre (a pioneer in women's free weight fitness) and became the number one women's fitness magazine. At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine Muscle & Fitness. Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present Shape, Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy. MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided. Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1987. Tara Kraft is the current editor-in-chief. Shape found a readership based on that formula.
Weider was purchased by American Media in 2002. A German version of Shape is available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The magazine is also edited in Romania.
On January 28, 2015, it was reported that Shape would be acquired by Meredith Corp. and Fitness, published by the company, would cease publication in May 2015 and be combined with it.
Thought 3: Shape magazine is a fitness magazine that focuses on health and wellness, but does not have a specific target readership for lesbian and queer-identified females. So Velvetpark is written more for a lesbian and queer-identified female readership.

Thought 2: I should also search Papa Gino's (headquarters) to confirm if it has a headquarters location and if it is further north than Pizza Inn's headquarters.
Action 2: Search[Papa Gino's (headquarters)]

As of 2023, there are 79 Papa Gino's locations in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.
Thought 3: Papa Gino's is based in Dedham, Massachusetts, which is further north than Pizza Inn's headquarters in The Colony, Texas. So Papa Gino's headquarters is further north than Pizza Inn's headquarters.
Action 3: Finish[Papa Gino's]
Observation 3: Answer is CORRECT

Question: The role of "Celene" in the film "Walk All over Me" was played by an actress that voices what role in the "Starcraft 2" triolgy?
Thought 1: I need to search "Walk All over Me" and find the actress who plays "Celene".
Action 1: Search[Walk All over Me]
Observation 1: Walk All over Me is a 2007 Canadian film written by Robert Cuffley and Jason Long. The film stars Leelee Sobieski as "Alberta", a small-town girl who assumes the false identity of her former babysitter and current dominatrix roommate "Celene", played by Tricia Helfer. Lothaire Bluteau, Michael Eklund, Michael Adamthwaite, and Jacob Tierney also star in the film. It was directed by Cuffley and produced by Carolyn McMaster.
Walk All over Me premiere at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, where it was bought by The Weinstein Company.
Thought 2: The actress who plays "Celene" is Tricia Helfer. I need to search "Starcraft 2" and find the role she voices.
Action 2: Search[Starcraft 2]
Observation 2: StarCraft is a military science fiction media franchise created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney and owned by Blizzard Entertainment. The series, set in the beginning of the 26th century, centers on a galactic struggle for dominance among four species—the adaptable and mobile Terrans, the ever-evolving insectoid Zerg, the powerful and enigmatic Protoss, and the godlike Xel'Naga creator race—in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector. The series debuted with the video game StarCraft in 1998. It has grown to include a number of other games as well as eight novelizations, two Amazing Stories articles, a board game and other licensed merchandise, such as collectible statues and toys.
Blizzard Entertainment began planning StarCraft in 1995 with a development team led by Metzen and Phinney. The game debuted at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo and used a modified Warcraft II game engine. StarCraft also marked the creation of Blizzard Entertainment's film department; the game introduced high quality cinematics integral to the storyline of the series. Most of the original development team for StarCraft returned to work on the game's expansion pack, Brood War; that game's development began only shortly after StarCraft was released. In 2001, StarCraft: Ghost began development under Nihilistic Software. Unlike the previous real-time strategy games in the series, Ghost was to be a stealth-action game. After three years of development, work on the game was postponed in 2004. Development of a true RTS sequel, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, began in 2003; the game was announced in May 2007 and was released in July 2010. StarCraft II continued with the StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm expansion, which was released in March 2013. The third and final StarCraft II installment, Legacy of the Void, was released in November 2015. In 2016, a single-player nine-mission pack, Nova Covert Ops, was released in form of DLC.
The original game and its expansion have been praised as one of the benchmark real-time strategy games of its time. The series has gathered a solid following around the world, particularly in South Korea, where professional players and teams participate in matches, earn sponsorships, and compete in televised matches. By June 2007, StarCraft and Brood War had sold nearly 10 million copies combined. StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty and its sequels obtained similar praise, and also sold very well. By the end of 2017, the franchise's lifetime revenue totaled over $1 billion. In addition, the series was awarded a star on the Walk of Game in 2006, and holds four Guinness World Records in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition of 2008.
On March 27, 2017, Blizzard announced StarCraft: Remastered, a remastered version of the original StarCraft, with the core updates being up-to-date graphics and revised dialogue and audio. As of 2017, the original StarCraft, its Brood War expansion, and StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty are free to download and play from Blizzard's website.

Observation 1: The Odyssey (; Ancient Greek: Ὀδύσσεια, romanized: Odýsseia) is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. It is one of the oldest surviving works of literature and remains popular with modern audiences. Like the Iliad, the Odyssey is divided into 24 books. It follows the Greek hero and king of Ithaca, Odysseus, and his homecoming journey after the ten-year long Trojan War. His journey from Troy to Ithaca lasts an additional ten years, during which time he encounters many perils and all of his crewmates are killed. In Odysseus' long absence, he is presumed dead, leaving his wife Penelope and son Telemachus to contend with a group of unruly suitors competing for Penelope's hand in marriage.
The Odyssey was first written down in Homeric Greek in around the 8th or 7th century BC and, by the mid-6th century BC, had become part of the Greek literary canon. In antiquity, Homer's authorship was taken as true, but contemporary scholarship predominantly assumes that the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed independently, forming as part of long oral traditions. Given widespread illiteracy, the poem was performed for an audience by an aoidos or rhapsode.
Key themes in the epic include the ideas of nostos (νόστος; 'return', homecoming), wandering, xenia (ξενία; 'guest-friendship'), testing, and omens. Scholars still explore on the narrative significance of certain groups in the poem, such as women and slaves, who have larger roles than in other works of ancient literature. This focus is especially remarkable when contrasted with the Iliad, which centres the exploits of soldiers and kings during the Trojan War.
The Odyssey is regarded as one of the most significant works of the Western canon. The first English translation of the Odyssey was in the 16th century. Adaptations and re-imaginings continue to be produced across a wide variety of media. In 2018, when BBC Culture polled experts around the world to find literature's most enduring narrative, the Odyssey topped the list.

Observation 3: Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a 1956 American independent science-fiction horror film produced by Walter Wanger, directed by Don Siegel, and starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter. The black-and-white film was shot in 2.00:1 Superscope and in the film noir style. Daniel Mainwaring adapted the screenplay from Jack Finney's 1954 science-fiction novel The Body Snatchers. The film was released by Allied Artists Pictures as a double feature with the British science-fiction film The Atomic Man (and in some markets with Indestructible Man).
The film's storyline concerns an extraterrestrial invasion that begins in the fictional California town of Santa Mira. Alien plant spores have fallen from space and grown into large seed pods, each one capable of producing a visually identical copy of a human. As each pod reaches full development, it assimilates the physical traits, memories, and personalities of each sleeping person placed near it until only the replacement is left; these duplicates, however, are devoid of all human emotion. Little by little, a local doctor uncovers this "quiet" invasion and attempts to stop it.
The slang expression "pod people" that arose in late 20th-century U.S. culture refers to the emotionless duplicates seen in the film. Invasion of the Body Snatchers was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

It follows the Greek hero and king of Ithaca, Odysseus, and his homecoming journey after the ten-year long Trojan War. His journey from Troy to Ithaca lasts an additional ten years, during which time he encounters many perils and all of his crewmates are killed. In Odysseus' long absence, he is presumed dead, leaving his wife Penelope and son Telemachus to contend with a group of unruly suitors competing for Penelope's hand in marriage.
The Odyssey was first written down in Homeric Greek in around the 8th or 7th century BC and, by the mid-6th century BC, had become part of the Greek literary canon. In antiquity, Homer's authorship was taken as true, but contemporary scholarship predominantly assumes that the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed independently, forming as part of long oral traditions. Given widespread illiteracy, the poem was performed for an audience by an aoidos or rhapsode.
Key themes in the epic include the ideas of nostos (νόστος; 'return', homecoming), wandering, xenia (ξενία; 'guest-friendship'), testing, and omens. Scholars still explore on the narrative significance of certain groups in the poem, such as women and slaves, who have larger roles than in other works of ancient literature. This focus is especially remarkable when contrasted with the Iliad, which centres the exploits of soldiers and kings during the Trojan War.
The Odyssey is regarded as one of the most significant works of the Western canon. The first English translation of the Odyssey was in the 16th century. Adaptations and re-imaginings continue to be produced across a wide variety of media. In 2018, when BBC Culture polled experts around the world to find literature's most enduring narrative, the Odyssey topped the list.

Observation 2: Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a 1956 American independent science-fiction horror film produced by Walter Wanger, directed by Don Siegel, and starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter. The black-and-white film was shot in 2.00:1 Superscope and in the film noir style. Daniel Mainwaring adapted the screenplay from Jack Finney's 1954 science-fiction novel The Body Snatchers. The film was released by Allied Artists Pictures as a double feature with the British science-fiction film The Atomic Man (and in some markets with Indestructible Man).
The film's storyline concerns an extraterrestrial invasion that begins in the fictional California town of Santa Mira. Alien plant spores have fallen from space and grown into large seed pods, each one capable of producing a visually identical copy of a human. As each pod reaches full development, it assimilates the physical traits, memories, and personalities of each sleeping person placed near it until only the replacement is left; these duplicates, however, are devoid of all human emotion. Little by little, a local doctor uncovers this "quiet" invasion and attempts to stop it.
The slang expression "pod people" that arose in late 20th-century U.S. culture refers to the emotionless duplicates seen in the film. Invasion of the Body Snatchers was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."
Thought 3: The Odyssey was first written down in Homeric Greek in around the 8th or 7th century BC. "You're Next" was released in 2012. So the movie that was filmed first is "The Guest".

Observation 2: Prince of Persia is a video game franchise created by Jordan Mechner. It is centered around a series of action-adventure games focused on various incarnations of the eponymous Prince, set in ancient and medieval Persia. 
The first two games in the series, Prince of Persia (1989) and Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame (1993), were published by Broderbund. Prince of Persia 3D (1999), named for being the first installment to use 3D computer graphics, was developed by Red Orb Entertainment and published by The Learning Company on PC; the Dreamcast version was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive. Ubisoft bought the rights to the franchise in 2001 and rebooted it with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003). Ubisoft has since developed and published five additional entries in the series: Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), Prince of Persia (2008), Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010), and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (2024), as well as a number of spin-offs and games for mobile devices.
Outside of the games, the franchise includes a film adaptation based on The Sands of Time, written in part by Mechner, and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2010; a graphic novel; and the Lego Prince of Persia toyline. Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed franchise is considered to be the spiritual successor to the series.
Thought 3: The director of The Prince and Me film franchise is not mentioned in the observation, so I need to search for the director of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.
Action 3: Search[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]
Observation 3: Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a 2003 action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on the Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox and Windows in November 2003. The Sands of Time is a reboot of the Prince of Persia series created by Jordan Mechner. Mechner served as creative consultant, designer, and scenario writer for The Sands of Time.
The game follows an unnamed Prince whose father sacks an ancient city at the instigation of a traitorous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince obtains an artifact called the Dagger of Time, while his father's army captures an hourglass containing the mysterious Sands of Time. Visiting the palace of the Sultan of Azad to present the Sands as a gift, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, transforming the people of Azad into savage monsters under his control. Together with Farah, a young Princess who knows the power of the Sands, the Prince works to correct his mistake and foil the Vizier's evil plans. The gameplay revolves around the Prince's platforming abilities, broken up by fights with the creatures created by the Sands. A key mechanic in the game is using the Dagger to rewind time if the Prince makes a mistake while platforming and use it to kill and freeze enemies.
Concept work began in spring of 2001, after Ubisoft acquired the Prince of Persia catalog. After Mechner was brought on board, production began in June of that year. After the initial story draft was scrapped as it was too complex, the team began with four guiding concepts, including the ability to rewind time: this idea grew into the Dagger, the Sands, and the various powers related to them. Mechner's script drew inspiration from the Shahnameh, with the main focus on creating a simple narrative that worked with the pace of gameplay. The game used Ubisoft's Jade engine, originally designed for Beyond Good & Evil, another game published by the company. Production was troubled, with the team facing problems with the engine structure and delays with environment assets, while also managing to create an effective tester network to seek out the game's bugs. In 2004, a version for mobile phones was developed and published in North America by Gameloft.
Upon release, The Sands of Time received critical acclaim, being nominated for and winning numerous awards and has been recognized by many as one of the greatest video games ever made. Sales were initially slow, but it eventually became a commercial success. A sequel, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within, was released in November 2004. Further games set in the Sands of Time continuity have been developed, and Sands of Time is generally cited as the reason for the Prince of Persia series' return to fame. As of 2014, the game has sold over 14 million copies worldwide, across all platforms. A remake was announced to be in development in 2020 and, following some delays, is currently scheduled for a 2026 release.

Observation 5: Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones is a 2005 action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and Ubisoft Casablanca, and published by Ubisoft for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, Xbox and Java (mobile phones only). It was later ported to the PlayStation Portable and Wii in 2007 under the title Prince of Persia: Rival Swords. The Wii version utilizes the motion-sensing functionality of its controller, while the PSP version added exclusive content and local multiplayer.
The Two Thrones is the sixth main installment of the Prince of Persia series, and the final chapter of the Sands of Time trilogy, but is not the last game to be set in its continuity. The story follows the Prince as he returns to his home in Babylon, only to find that his actions in Warrior Within have undone the events of The Sands of Time. The villainous Vizier is back from the dead and kills the Prince's companion Kaileena, absorbing the Sands of Time from her, which transform him into an immortal monster. Now, the Prince must work together with his past love Farah (whom he meets for the first time in this new timeline) to defeat the Vizier once and for all, while also struggling against his own Dark Prince persona, which is slowly corrupting him.
Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews, with praise for its story, characters, level design, graphics, combat and new speed kill mechanic, but the PSP and Wii versions reviewed significantly worse than the others. It was also a commercial success, selling over 1.5 million copies within one month of release. Following The Two Thrones, the series was rebooted a second time with 2008's Prince of Persia.

Action 7: Search[Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands film adaptation]
Observation 7: Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands refers to a group of 2010 action-adventure games developed and published by Ubisoft, with each version handled by different internal teams. The main version was developed for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows; other versions were developed for Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, mobile and web browsers, and a notable version for the Wii. It forms part of the Prince of Persia series, and is set within the continuity of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003).
All versions of the game are set between The Sands of Time and Warrior Within (2004). The stories follow an unnamed Prince on adventures through the lands of ancient Persia, dealing with magical threats with the aid of different djinn. While gameplay varies between the different versions, they all revolve around platforming and puzzle solving, in addition to magical powers based around the manipulation of time or the elements.
Development of The Forgotten Sands began alongside the 2008 series reboot to correspond with the movie adaptation of The Sands of Time. After the film was delayed, the games' concept was reworked to be in the same series rather than a direct tie-in. The different versions were developed by different Ubisoft divisions worldwide, with the Nintendo-based and PSP versions having unique stories and gameplay. The development team's main goal was a return to the series' traditional roots after the reboot's period of experimentation. The game received mixed to positive reviews for most platforms, with the PSP and DS versions faring the worst, and was generally seen as inferior to previous installments in the series. After the release of Forgotten Sands, the series went on hiatus until the release of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown in early 2024.

Observation 2: Prince of Persia is a video game franchise created by Jordan Mechner. It is centered around a series of action-adventure games focused on various incarnations of the eponymous Prince, set in ancient and medieval Persia. 
The first two games in the series, Prince of Persia (1989) and Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame (1993), were published by Broderbund. Prince of Persia 3D (1999), named for being the first installment to use 3D computer graphics, was developed by Red Orb Entertainment and published by The Learning Company on PC; the Dreamcast version was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive. Ubisoft bought the rights to the franchise in 2001 and rebooted it with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003). Ubisoft has since developed and published five additional entries in the series: Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), Prince of Persia (2008), Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010), and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (2024), as well as a number of spin-offs and games for mobile devices.

Question: What was a series of battles during the Revolutionary War, for control of New York City and the state of New Jersey, fought on October 28, 1776 near White Plains, New York?
Thought 1: I need to search Revolutionary War, find the battles fought on October 28, 1776 near White Plains, New York, then find the name of the series of battles.
Action 1: Search[Revolutionary War]
Observation 1: The American Revolutionary War (April 19, 1775 – September 3, 1783), also known as the Revolutionary War or American War of Independence, was an armed conflict that comprised the final eight years of the broader American Revolution, in which American Patriot forces organized as the Continental Army and commanded by George Washington defeated the British Army. The conflict was fought in North America, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean. The war ended with the Treaty of Paris (1783), which resulted in the establishment of the United States of America as an independent nation, which was recognized by Great Britain and other nations of the world.
In 1763, after the British Empire gained dominance in North America following its victory over the French in the Seven Years' War, tensions and disputes began escalating between the British and the Thirteen Colonies, especially following passage of Stamp and Townshend Acts by the British Parliament. The British Army responded by seeking to occupy Boston militarily, leading to the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. 
In mid-1774, with tensions escalating even further between the British Army and the colonies, the British Parliament imposed the Intolerable Acts, an attempt to disarm Americans, leading to the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, the first battles of the Revolutionary War. In June 1775, the Second Continental Congress, including 56 colonial delegates, convened in present-day Independence Hall in the colonial capital of Philadelphia, incorporating colonial-based Patriot militias into one single military, the Continental Army, and appointing Washington as its commander-in-chief. 
Two months later, in August 1775, the British Parliament declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion. In July 1776, the Second Continental Congress embraced and formalized the war, passing the Lee Resolution on July 2, and, two days later, unanimously adopting the Declaration of Independence, on July 4.
In March 1776, in an early win for the newly-formed Continental Army under Washington's command, following a successful siege of Boston, the Continental Army successfully drove the British Army out of Boston. British commander in chief William Howe responded by launching the New York and New Jersey campaign, which resulted in Howe's capture of New York City in November. Washington responded by clandestinely crossing the Delaware River and winning small but significant victories at Trenton and Princeton. 
In the summer of 1777, as Howe was poised to capture Philadelphia, the Continental Congress fled to Baltimore. In October 1777, a separate northern British force under the command of John Burgoyne was forced to surrender at Saratoga in an American victory that proved crucial in convincing France and Spain that an independent United States was a viable possibility. France signed a commercial agreement with the rebels, followed by a Treaty of Alliance in February 1778. In 1779, the Sullivan Expedition undertook a scorched earth campaign against the Iroquois who were largely allied with the British. Indian raids on the American frontier, however, continued to be a problem. Also, in 1779, Spain allied with France against Great Britain in the Treaty of Aranjuez, though Spain did not formally ally with the Americans.
Howe's replacement Henry Clinton intended to take the war against the Americans into the Southern Colonies. Despite some initial success, British General Cornwallis was besieged by a Franco-American force in Yorktown in September and October 1781. Cornwallis was forced to surrender in October. The British wars with France and Spain continued for another two years, but fighting largely ceased in North America. In the Treaty of Paris, ratified on September 3, 1783, Great Britain acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the United States, bringing the American Revolutionary War to an end. The Treaties of Versailles resolved Great Britain's conflicts with France and Spain and forced Great Britain to cede Tobago, Senegal, and small territories in India to France, and Menorca, West Florida and East Florida to Spain.
Thought 2: The battles fought on October 28, 1776 near White Plains, New York were part of the New York and New Jersey campaign.
Action 2: Search[New York and New Jersey campaign]
Observation 2: The New York and New Jersey campaign in 1776 and the winter months of 1777 was a series of American Revolutionary War battles for control of the Port of New York and the state of New Jersey, fought between British forces under General Sir William Howe and the Continental Army under General George Washington.  Howe was successful in driving Washington out of New York, but overextended his reach into New Jersey, and ended the New York and New Jersey campaign in January 1777 with only a few outposts near New York City under British control. The British held New York Harbor for the rest of the Revolutionary War, using it as a base for expeditions against other targets.
Landing unopposed on Staten Island on July 3, 1776, Howe had assembled an army that included components that had withdrawn from Boston in March following the British failure to hold that city, combined with additional British troops, and Hessian troops hired from several German principalities. Washington's Continental Army included New England soldiers and regiments from the Thirteen Colonies as far south as the Colony of Virginia. Landing on Long Island in August, Howe defeated Washington in the largest battle of the war in North America, but the Continental Army was able to regroup and make an orderly and covert retreat to Manhattan that night under a cover of darkness and fog. Washington suffered a series of further defeats in Manhattan but prevailed in a skirmish at the Battle of Harlem Heights and eventually withdrew his troops successfully to White Plains, New York. Howe, meanwhile, returned to Manhattan and captured those forces Washington had left on the island.
Washington and much of his army crossed the Hudson River to Rockland County and then south into New Jersey, retreated across the state, and then crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. Along the way, his army shrunk due to the ending of enlistment periods, desertions, and poor morale. Howe ordered his troops into winter quarters in December, establishing a chain of outposts from New York City to Burlington, New Jersey.  Washington, in a tremendous boost to American morale, launched a successful strike against the Trenton garrison on the morning of December 26, 1776, prompting Howe to withdraw his chain of outposts back to New Brunswick and the coast near New York. Washington, in turn, established his winter camp at Morristown.  During the following winter months and through the rest of the war, both sides skirmished frequently around New York City and New Jersey as the British sought forage and provisions.
Britain maintained control of New York City and some of the surrounding territory until the war ended in 1783, using it as a base for operations elsewhere in North America.  In 1777, General Howe launched a campaign to capture the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia, leaving General Sir Henry Clinton in command of the New York area, while General John Burgoyne led an attempt to gain control of the Hudson River valley, moving south from Quebec and being defeated at Saratoga.

For the role he earned the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series as well as a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. He reprised the role across several series including Homicide: Life on the Street (1996–1999), Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999–2000), Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2001), and Law & Order: Trial by Jury (2005). He also played private detective Harry McGraw in the CBS murder-mystery series Murder, She Wrote (1985–1991), and The Law & Harry McGraw (1987–1988).
On film, Orbach often took numerous supporting roles such as a detective in the crime drama Prince of the City (1981), a coach in the comedy film Brewster's Millions (1985), an overly protective father in romance film Dirty Dancing (1987), and a mobster in the drama Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989).

Nutt in Boston, Massachusetts, as a privately owned company with initial backing from TA Associates; Its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange occurred in November 1997.  Today, AMG's Affiliates manage $651 billion in assets in aggregate.
AMG's strategy is to generate value by investing in an array of independent firms and supporting their long-term growth, through an approach in which significant equity ownership is retained by the management partners of each Affiliate, and each Affiliate operates and invests autonomously from AMG and from other Affiliates.  The Affiliate principals’ ‘skin in the game’ incentivizes them to maximize long-term value creation, and their retained investment independence preserves the entrepreneurial cultures of each Affiliate firm.  AMG's approach aligns incentives between AMG shareholders, Affiliate principals, and Affiliate clients, and is unique in the investment industry.  AMG also offers its Affiliates growth capital, distribution and marketing capabilities, and other strategic support, and its intention is to "magnify" its Affiliates’ growth opportunities without interfering in their operations.

Thought 1: I need to search Wallace & Gromit, find the animation comedy that matches animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes, and return the name of the animation comedy.
Action 1: Search[Wallace & Gromit]
Observation 1: Wallace & Gromit is a British claymation comedy franchise created by Nick Park and produced by Aardman Animations.  The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic beagle. It consists of four short films, two feature-length films, and numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was finished and released in 1989. Wallace has been voiced by Peter Sallis and Ben Whitehead. While Wallace speaks very often, Gromit is largely silent and has no dialogue, communicating through facial expressions and body language.
Because of their popularity, the characters have been described as positive international cultural icons of both modern British culture and British people in general. BBC News called them "some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK". Icons has said they have done "more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors".
Park has stated that he was inspired by his childhood through the 1950s and 1960s in Lancashire in Northern England. The setting is deliberately ambiguous: the overall style resembles the 1960s, but numerous anachronisms abound, such as the use of 21st-century technology. Although Wigan is seen at the end of Wallace's alliterative home address on his letters, his accent comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire and he is especially fond of Wensleydale cheese (from North Yorkshire).
Their films have been widely praised, with the first three short films, A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995) earning 100% on Rotten Tomatoes; the feature film Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) has also received acclaim. The film is the second-highest-grossing stop-motion animated film, outgrossed only by Chicken Run (2000), another creation of Park's. A fourth short film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was released in 2008. A second full-length feature film, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl — marking the return of the penguin Feathers McGraw, the villain from The Wrong Trousers — was released in 2024. The franchise has received numerous accolades, including five BAFTAs, three Academy Awards and a Peabody Award.

Observation 2: StarCraft is a military science fiction media franchise created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney and owned by Blizzard Entertainment. The series, set in the beginning of the 26th century, centers on a galactic struggle for dominance among four species—the adaptable and mobile Terrans, the ever-evolving insectoid Zerg, the powerful and enigmatic Protoss, and the godlike Xel'Naga creator race—in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector. The series debuted with the video game StarCraft in 1998. It has grown to include a number of other games as well as eight novelizations, two Amazing Stories articles, a board game and other licensed merchandise, such as collectible statues and toys.
Blizzard Entertainment began planning StarCraft in 1995 with a development team led by Metzen and Phinney. The game debuted at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo and used a modified Warcraft II game engine. StarCraft also marked the creation of Blizzard Entertainment's film department; the game introduced high quality cinematics integral to the storyline of the series. Most of the original development team for StarCraft returned to work on the game's expansion pack, Brood War; that game's development began only shortly after StarCraft was released. In 2001, StarCraft: Ghost began development under Nihilistic Software. Unlike the previous real-time strategy games in the series, Ghost was to be a stealth-action game. After three years of development, work on the game was postponed in 2004. Development of a true RTS sequel, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, began in 2003; the game was announced in May 2007 and was released in July 2010. StarCraft II continued with the StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm expansion, which was released in March 2013. The third and final StarCraft II installment, Legacy of the Void, was released in November 2015. In 2016, a single-player nine-mission pack, Nova Covert Ops, was released in form of DLC.
The original game and its expansion have been praised as one of the benchmark real-time strategy games of its time. The series has gathered a solid following around the world, particularly in South Korea, where professional players and teams participate in matches, earn sponsorships, and compete in televised matches. By June 2007, StarCraft and Brood War had sold nearly 10 million copies combined. StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty and its sequels obtained similar praise, and also sold very well. By the end of 2017, the franchise's lifetime revenue totaled over $1 billion. In addition, the series was awarded a star on the Walk of Game in 2006, and holds four Guinness World Records in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition of 2008.
On March 27, 2017, Blizzard announced StarCraft: Remastered, a remastered version of the original StarCraft, with the core updates being up-to-date graphics and revised dialogue and audio. As of 2017, the original StarCraft, its Brood War expansion, and StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty are free to download and play from Blizzard's website.

Observation 1: Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1997. They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer and percussionist Will Champion, and manager Phil Harvey. They are best known for their live performances, and their impact on popular culture through their music, advocacy and achievements.
The members of the band initially met at University College London, calling themselves Big Fat Noises and changing to Starfish, before settling on the current name. After releasing Safety (1998) independently, Coldplay signed with Parlophone in 1999 and issued their debut album, Parachutes (2000), featuring the breakthrough single "Yellow". It earned a Brit Award for British Album of the Year and a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. The group's follow-up, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), won the same accolades. X&Y (2005) completed what they regarded as a trilogy and was shortlisted for Best Rock Album at the Grammy Awards. Its successor, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), prevailed in the category. Both releases were the best-sellers of their respective years, topping the charts in over 30 countries. Viva la Vida's title track was the first song from a British act to lead the Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart simultaneously in the 21st century.
Coldplay further expanded their repertoire in subsequent albums, with Mylo Xyloto (2011), Ghost Stories (2014), A Head Full of Dreams (2015), Everyday Life (2019), Music of the Spheres (2021) and Moon Music (2024) drawing from genres like electronica, R&B, ambient, disco, funk, gospel, blues and progressive rock. The group's additional endeavours include philanthropy, politics and activism, supporting numerous humanitarian projects and donating 10% of their profits to charity. In 2018, a career-spanning film directed by Mat Whitecross was released for their 20th anniversary.
With over 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay are one of the best-selling music acts of all time. They are also the first group in Spotify history to reach 90 million monthly listeners. Fuse listed them among the most awarded artists, which includes holding the record for most Brit Awards won by a band. In the United Kingdom, they own three of the 50 best-selling albums, the most UK Albums Chart leaders without missing the top (10), and were ranked as the country's most played group of the 21st century. In 2021, "My Universe" was the first song by a British outfit to enter the Billboard Hot 100 at number one. Coldplay have two of the highest-grossing tours of all time and the most attended. The British Phonographic Industry called them one of the most "influential and pioneering acts" in the world, while the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame added A Rush of Blood to the Head to the 200 Definitive Albums list and "Yellow" to the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll exhibition. In 2023, Time cited the group among the most impactful climate action figures. Despite their renown, they are considered polarising cultural icons.

Observation 2: Shape  (stylized in all caps) is an American monthly fitness magazine started by Weider Publications in 1981, founded by Christine MacIntyre (a pioneer in women's free weight fitness) and became the number one women's fitness magazine. At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine Muscle & Fitness. Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present Shape, Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy. MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided. Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1987. Tara Kraft is the current editor-in-chief. Shape found a readership based on that formula.
Weider was purchased by American Media in 2002. A German version of Shape is available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The magazine is also edited in Romania.
On January 28, 2015, it was reported that Shape would be acquired by Meredith Corp. and Fitness, published by the company, would cease publication in May 2015 and be combined with it.
Thought 3: Shape magazine is a fitness magazine that focuses on health and wellness, but does not have a specific target readership for lesbian and queer-identified females. So Velvetpark is written more for a lesbian and queer-identified female readership.
